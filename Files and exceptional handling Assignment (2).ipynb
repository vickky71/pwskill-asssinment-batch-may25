    "\n",
    "Python uses reference counting to track memory, but when two or more objects reference each other, they may not get collected automatically. This leads to memory being held unnecessarily unless the cyclic garbage collector explicitly detects and removes them.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  **2. Memory Leaks**\n",
    "\n",
    "Improper handling of large data structures, global variables, or persistent references can result in memory leaks, where memory is no longer needed but not released. This can degrade performance, especially in long-running applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the GIL, Python allows only one thread to execute at a time in a single process. This can lead to **inefficient memory utilization** in multi-threaded, CPU-bound programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. High Memory Overhead**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level language with dynamic typing. Each object in Python carries metadata and type information, which increases **memory consumption** compared to low-level languages like C or C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Delayed Garbage Collection**\n",
    "\n",
    "The garbage collector may not immediately collect unused objects, especially in cases of low memory pressure. This can lead to **temporary memory bloating**.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  **Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    " While Python provides built-in memory management tools, developers must still be aware of issues like circular references, memory leaks, and high memory overhead. Proper coding practices and monitoring tools are essential to manage memory efficiently and ensure high performance in Python applications.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Ans:In Python, you can raise an exception manually using the raise keyword. This is useful when you want to intentionally trigger an error based on specific conditions in your program.Raising exceptions manually helps developers enforce rules, validate data, and handle errors in a controlled and meaningful way.The raise statement in Python allows developers to manually throw exceptions when certain conditions are not met. This improves error handling, ensures data integrity, and makes the program more robust and maintainable.\n",
